# A-Class-a-Day

Hello and welcome to my repository!  Hopefully you're here from the link on my resume or LinkedIn and wanted to see what I've been up to.  
The purpose or goal of this repo is to showcase my learning of new lanuguages and tools that I couldn't have obtained from just school and documenting my progress. 
Essentially what I'm doing is taking online courses offered by Udemy and trying to take a class or write a class each day to better my skills. 
I'll be organizing each course into it's own folder containing: any code I've written, a list of new things I've learned, and a final project that combines all the new things I've learned.
This is still in the early changes so I will update this document from time to time so suit whatever I think should be here.  

As of 12/22/2020 this is where I'd rate myself in the following skills that are on my resume:

| Skill  | Rating out of 5.0 | Way Learned |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Python  | 4.0 | School |
| C  | 3.5  | School |
| Microcontrollers | 3.5 | School |
| C#  | 3.0  | Work |
| SQL | 3.0 | Work |
|Verilog | 3.0 | School |

The main skills I want to focus on are C#, SQL, Python, and a multitude of tools or APIs that are commonly used in industry.  Currently I'm unemployed so this will be my main focus for a short time before going back to applying to jobs.
If anything in this repo catches your eye please feel free to reach out to me and I'll gladly explain anything I've worked on.  Enjoy!
